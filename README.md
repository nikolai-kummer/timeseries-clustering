# Time Series Clustering

## Overview

This repository focuses on experiments with clustering techniques applied to time series data. 
Clustering time series can help in identifying patterns, grouping similar sequences, and uncovering underlying structures in temporal data.


## Repository Structure

- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the project.
- `src/`: Includes the source code implementing the clustering algorithms and related utilities.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and guidance on the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikolai-kummer/timeseries-clustering.git
   cd timeseries-clustering

2. **Run main.py**:
    ```bash
    python src\main.py
    ```
  
3. **Open resulting report**

    The script will generate some time series and export them into an html file to view the results.
